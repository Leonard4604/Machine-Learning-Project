## Machine Learning project for Sapienza's course in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning of Engineering in Computer Science

#### About the project:

This project is finalised to learn how a neural network works with a Q-Learning approach.
It is best suited for the Cart Pole environment of OpenAI Gym, but can be adapted to whatever environment.

***

#### Files structure:
In [scores](scores) you can find a little snippet useful to make fancy graphs for drawing the results/scores of our tests. 
Also, there will be saved all the graphs that you need.

In the [source](deep-q-network.py) you can find the source code for our project.
There will be also created a folder for weights/models when you want to save them through their relative methods of the class.
